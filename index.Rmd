## Overview
- This data product provides the basic model to predict the probability that the passengers on the Titanic will survive. 
- The data used to train this model is on Kaggle's Titanic challenge, which you can download from Kaggles's page:

## Logistic Regression
- The technique that used to build this model called **the Logistic Regression**.

## Getting Started
- On the left sidebar, you can change the input parameters.
- Then, the results will automatically calculate how likely to survive or die depend on the characteristics of the passenger you specified in the left sidebar.
